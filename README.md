## Features
Bookworms is an app that helps you organize your reading life. With Bookworms, you can keep track of books you've read and want to read, visualize your reading history and progress, schedule meetings for book clubs you're in, chat with other book club members, and create polls for your book clubs to decide on what to read next, when to meet, and where to meet.

## Technologies
Bookworms runs on a Heroku server using Node JS, PostgreSQL/Sequelize, Express, React, and Redux. We also used Material UI as our front-end framework, Socket.io to implement our threaded messaging/chat feature, and Push.js to build real-time desktop notifications. Our book data is powered by the Goodreads API, and we visualized reading history and progress using Recharts.js. Working on a product that has tangible real-world applications was rewarding and fun for all of us, and we hope that anyone who loves to read will enjoy using Bookworms!
